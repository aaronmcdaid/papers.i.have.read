Notes/comments:
- The abstract says that summary stat imputation gets worse RMSE. I expected it to be at least as good, or perhaps even better, because genotype imputation results in discrete imputation even where something fuzzy is more appropriate.
- What's the difference between a SNV and a SNP. I forget!
